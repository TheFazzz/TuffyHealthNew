# TuffyHealthNew
Created new project using MVC dotnet 6 instead of 7. This one using Identity, so we have framework to do login, register, authentication, 
roles if we decide to do that. The database is linked in and connected to a cloud server, I ended up doing a SQL database so we can use
Identity Frameworks. Right now I just have the user Table and some other identity tables we can use if we decide too. Bryan i tried to copy
over your index page, but its off a little bit( i prolly just copied it over wrong, needs a little adjustment).
